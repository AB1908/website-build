## What is this?

You could just call this a public ramble.
But really, it's just a series of thoughts or notes on stuff I've found interesting.
I'm sure people have experienced or already know most of what I'll probably write about since [[nothing is ever original]] but even so, I enjoy writing and sharing.
It certainly doesn't help that I find too many things interesting but, on the flip side, more stuff to write about!

## Why is this?

Like any person who has struggled with memory, I write notes.
My initial desire for taking notes stemmed from constantly forgetting things that I had read or watched.
I never really took the time to understand how memory worked, which was odd considering how I often liked diving into minutiae.
^[Or I could just say I was lazy.]
It was compounded by my interest in data collection and hoarding.
^[[r/datahoarder] is that way.]
My final push came from watching [[Ali Abdaal]]'s videos.
He [explained][Ali - BASB YouTube] how notes were an integral part ^[[Link][Ali - BASB] to the accompanying blog post] of his ["second brain"][Building a Second Brain].
^[I'm beginning to dread the phrase but it has caught on.]
It was through his videos that I discovered [Notion].
You can read why I disliked it [[404|here]], which led me to Obsidian.

Things kinda snowballed from there and here I am on my own website trying to share what I'm thinking.
Since I'm here, here's a few shout-outs to some of my other inspirations: [xkcd][xkcd] [^aboutxkcd] (Randall Munroe), [Wait But Why][Wait But Why] (Tim Urban), [3Blue1Brown][3Blue1Brown] (Grant Sanderson), Gwern.net and [Sebastian Lague's YouTube channel][Sebastian Lague - YouTube]. ^[I'm probably forgetting quite a few others.]
I hope you enjoy reading my articles as much as I love writing them.
It's probably not the most eloquent or well informed stuff you'll find but hey, I'm trying.
Cheers!

## Where will this go?

Good question. I could paraphrase Captain Kirk ^[["To boldly go where no man has before"][Where no man has gone before] for the uninitiated among us.] but I'd be lying.

## What do you use?

For taking notes, my app of choice is [Obsidian] which aligns very closely with my personal philosophies on data ownership and privacy.
It's extremely extensible and it seems to have the perfect combination of features that I'm looking for.
^[I recently found [an extension][Obsidian Pandoc extension] for pandoc attributes!]
The community is extremely kind and helpful too, which always helps.
It runs offline (unlike Notion) and I always have my data with me.
^[I may even have my first Notion convert soon. You know who you are!]
There are some concerns of Obsidian using non standard Markdown spec ^[Fellow nerds will know this as [CommonMark Spec].] but I digress.

As for publishing my thoughts and articles, I don't use [Obsidian Publish] as I feel that I want to structure content in my own fashion.
I settled on [GitHub Pages] for now which is apparently a [Jekyll] site generator behind the scenes and it looks nice and minimalist to me.
I wished I could use [Textile][Textile] but seeing as how my notes are already in Markdown and I'm already parsing them through [pandoc][pandoc], the Swiss army knife of document converters, I can't bear to add my friction to my workflow. ^[Pandoc Markdown is just as versatile, it turns out.]
I also love [structuring content semantically][Semantic Line Breaks].
[Version control] is always important too, hence [git].
The two things above help me generate nice diffs should I ever want to.

I absolutely love sidenotes and footnotes so anyone who finds my rather frequent remarks annoying can always just ignore them.
In my opinion, they inject a bit of personality to an otherwise heartless page of reading.
I use a modified version of [Tufte CSS][Tufte CSS] ^[Such a beautiful website!] which I found by perusing through Gwern's blog post.
^[Truly one of the hallmarks of blogging. I strongly suggest reading through his stuff. The man uses a custom JS script to load his footnotes.]
The modification part took quite a bit of time and I've described that entire headache [[Footnotes in web content]].
My font of choice is [Crimson Text][Crimson Text] and my base Jekyll theme is Primer. ^[I didn't like the other choices.]
I will no doubt switch to a more Obsidian-like theme soon but I aim to get more stuff written first.
^[[[Perfect is the enemy of good]].]

I've also found that [karlicoss] has [an amazing blog][karlicoss's blog] ^[It's really really good if you're a programming nerd and are also into knowledge management.] built atop of [org-mode] but my journey with that is yet to begin.<!-- #website/org-mode  -->
[Vim] is a must have, in my opinion, so vim bindings wherever possible.

[^aboutxkcd]: The [About page][XKCD About] explains that it's stylised as "xkcd" or "XKCD" for [[The Elements of Style]] readers.

	[How do I write "xkcd"? There's nothing in Strunk and White about this.]{.blockquote}
	
	[For those of us pedantic enough to want a rule, here it is: The preferred form is "xkcd", all lower-case. In formal contexts where a lowercase word shouldn't start a sentence, "XKCD" is an okay alternative. "Xkcd" is frowned upon.]{.blockquote}
